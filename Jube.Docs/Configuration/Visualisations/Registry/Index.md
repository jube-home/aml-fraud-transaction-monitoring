# Visualisation Registry
Think of a Visualisation Registry as a report. The Visualisation Registry can have many Datasource's which share a common set of parameters.  The Visualisation Registry is the wrapper and specifies the the size of the canvass for the datasource's to be arranged.  The registry entry also controls the availability of navigation to the Visualisation through the Visualisation Directory.

To create a Visualisation Registry,  navigate Administration >> Visualisation >> Visualisation Registry:

The Visualisation Registry takes the following parameters:

| Value             | Description                                                                                                                                  | Example |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Show In Directory | A flag indicating is the Visualisation is to be presented in the Visualisation page (otherwise available only in the Case page as embedded). | True    |
| Columns           | The number of columns that the Visualization Registry will be divided into for the purpose of arranging the Datasource's, or tiles.          | 6       |
| Column Width      | Given the columns having been specified,  the size in pixels of each column.                                                                 | 300     |
| Row Height        | Rows are otherwise unbounded,  however,  like columns,  have their size in pixels specified.                                                 | 300     |
