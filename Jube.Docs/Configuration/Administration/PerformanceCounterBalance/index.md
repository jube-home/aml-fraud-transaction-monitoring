# Performance Counter Balance
The nature of the Jube Platform is that immeasurable harm can be caused by the misconfiguration of a rule.  Consider a scenario where all bank transactions are declined or all bidding is taking place on all impression opportunities as a consequence of a bad Activation Rule.  Furthermore,  the nature of real-time,  ultra-high throughput systems,  is that it is not especially feasible to measure performance on a transaction by transaction basis, instead relying on near time aggregate counters and statistics to measure the performance of the platform.

Counters keep a track of events that take place in Jube.  There are two types of counter,  which are known as Rolling counters and Reset counters:

* Rolling Counters when being incremented keep a record of the date and time of each component causing the counter to be incremented,  which allow for the counter to be decremented at the point in time each counter entry expires.  The Rolling Counter will never be reset to zero, rather it will maintain a balance of counter entries moving in,  then moving out of the counter.
* Reset Counter are reset to zero every minute.

Rolling Counters include:
* Each time a Response Elevation is returned,  greater than zero,  a counter in incremented.
* Each time a Response Elevation is returned,  greater than zero,  a counter is increased by the value of the Response Elevation.  Rather than a counter,  it is a sum or balance.
* Each time a message is sent to the Activation Watcher,  a counter is incremented.

Reset Counters include:

* Each time an transaction is processed through a model,  a counter is incremented.
* Each time a Gateway Rule is matched upon,  a counter is incremented.
* Each time a request is received on the Web Server \ HTTP Endpoint,  a counter is incremented.
* Each time the HTTP Endpoint is switched to invoke an Entity Model,  a counter is incremented.
* Each time the HTTP Endpoint is switched to invoke Entity Model Tagging, a counter is incremented.
* Each time the HTTP Endpoint is switched to recall an Exhaustive Adaptation directly,   a counter is incremented.
* Each time the HTTP Endpoint is switched and has encountered an Error,  a counter is incremented.
* Each time the HTTP Endpoint is switched to invoke an Entity Model asynchronously,  a counter is incremented.

The HTTP counters can be inspected by navigating to Administration >>  Performance >> HTTP Processing Counters.

It can be observed throughout this documentation that in memory asynchronous queues features heavily in the platforms architecture. 

This counters routine is also responsible for recording the asynchronous queue balances on a snapshot basis.  

For each model the following asynchronous queue balances are maintained:

* The number of payload records pending initial processing by the bulk insert routine and case creation routine.
* The number of Activation Watcher entries pending dispatch and storage.

The model asynchronous queue balances can be inspected by navigating to Administration >>  Performance >> Model Asynchronous Queue Balances.

For the platform the following asynchronous queue balances are maintained in the overall execution:

* The number of Tags currently pending in the in memory asynchronous queue.
* The number of Real Time Model Invocation Entity objects pending invocation in the in memory asynchronous queue.

The asynchronous queue balances can be inspected by navigating to Administration >>  Performance >> Queue Asynchronous Balances.
