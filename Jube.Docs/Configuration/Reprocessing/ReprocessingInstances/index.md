To create a reprocessing request,  ensure that the Reprocessing Filter created beforehand is available:

Scroll down and locate the Reprocess button:

By clicking the Reprocess button,  an entry will be made in the database requesting the engine perform reprocessing as per the filter specification.

Only one reprocessing request may exist at any given point in time,  and a new request cannot be created until any unprocessed requests move to a completed state.

Click the Reprocess button:

The reprocessing job has the following processing steps:
