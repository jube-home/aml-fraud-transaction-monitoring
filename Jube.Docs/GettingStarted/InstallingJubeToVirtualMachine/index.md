# Installing Jube To Virtual Machine

Start by cloning the project from Github and changing to the executable directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jube-home/jube.git
cd jube/Jube.App
```

Noting the credentials from the Managed Postgres Database:

```text
username = doadmin
password = *******
host = db-postgresql-fra1-32549-do-user-12376516-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com
port = 25060
database = defaultdb
sslmode = require
```

Arrange the credentials into a connection string format as follows to be passed as an Environment Variable:

```shell
export ConnectionString="Host=<host>;Port=<port>;Database=<defaultdb>;Username=<username>;Password=<password>;Pooling=true;Minimum Pool Size=0;Maximum Pool Size=100;SSL Mode=Require;Trust Server Certificate=true;"
```

Or rather:

```shell
export ConnectionString="Host=db-postgresql-fra1-52677-do-user-12376516-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com;Port=25060;Database=defaultdb; Username=doadmin;Password=*******;Pooling=true;Minimum Pool Size=0;Maximum Pool Size=100;SSL Mode=Require;Trust Server Certificate=true;"
```

Execute the shell command to create the Environment Variable.

The User Interface and API endpoints need to passed the URL to bind to.  In this example, the public IP of the Droplet is 164.92.193.229 as observed in the Droplet page:

It is recommended that Jube always be behind a reverse proxy henceforth non standard ports are used,  in this case port 5001.  It follows that the Jube User Interface and API Endpoint will listen on https://164.92.193.229:5001/ which will be set in the ASPNETCORE_URLS Environment Variable:

```shell
export ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://143.198.224.41:5001/"
```

Execute the shell command to create the Environment Variable.

For the purpose of illustration the dotnet run command will be used, however, for production it is extremely unlikely that this would be satisfactory,  instead it is far more likely that a formal release will be built for a specific operating system.  There is such an abundance of release techniques for .Net 6 applications that it exists outside the scope of this documentation.  The dotnet run command will build then run the application and it is perfectly adequate for comprehensive testing, proof of concept and smaller production implementations.  

Build and run Jube:

```shell
dotnet run
```

It will take some time to run firstly as the project will be compiled after which the startup message will be written out to the console.

Waiting a few moments will ensure that the Kestrel web server is properly started and the routing configurations are in place.  In a web browser navigate to the biding https://164.92.193.229:5001/ set in the ASPNETCORE_URLS Environment Variable.

The default user name \ password combination is Administrator \ Administrator,  although the password will be need to be changed on first login.
