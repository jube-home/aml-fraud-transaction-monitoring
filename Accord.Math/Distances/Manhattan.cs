    ///         Taxicab geometry, considered by Hermann Minkowski in 19th century Germany,
    ///         is a form of geometry in which the usual distance function of metric or
    ///         Euclidean geometry is replaced by a new metric in which the distance between
    ///         two points is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian
    ///         coordinates. The taxicab metric is also known as rectilinear distance, L1
    ///         distance or L1 norm (see Lp space), city block distance, Manhattan distance,
    ///         or Manhattan length, with corresponding variations in the name of the geometry.
    ///         The latter names allude to the grid layout of most streets on the island of
    ///         Manhattan, which causes the shortest path a car could take between two intersections
    ///         in the borough to have length equal to the intersections' distance in taxicab
