# Cases Workflow Status
When a case is created,  it can be allocated a status, which is helpful for filtering.  Furthermore,  when a case is being worked, changing the status allows for the sub allocation of the record (for example to a money laundering officer for review).  Statuses are separate from the closed status (i.e. Open,  Closed etc).

A common example for case status use is to escalate cases through a hierarchy in an money laundering team,  such as:

* Front Line Defence (FLD).
* Deputy Anti Money Laundering Compliance Officer (DAMLCO).
* Anti Money Laundering Compliance Officer (AMLCO).

To begin the addition of Cases Workflow Status,  navigate to Administration >> Models >> Cases Workflows >> Cases Workflow Status:

Cases Workflows Status is a child of Cases Workflows, itself a Child of Models.  It follows that the tree to administer models and cases workflows is now of three levels deep.

It is incumbent to expand upon the model to reveal the Cases Workflows entry:

|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Priority           | The priority of the workflow flow entry.  A status can be upwardly classified, such that if a case record already exists, the priority can be raised for that record, yet the priority of a case record may never decrease. | High    |
| Status Fore Colour | The colour of the text for this status.  The colour is used in the main bar on the status page.                                                                                                                             | #0000FF |
| Status Back Colour | The colour of the background for this status,  the colour is the main bar on the status page.                                                                                                                               | #880808 |
