# Case Workflow Filter
Throughout a case life cycle,  a case record can move through a multitude of dispositions.  The most simple is the hard-coded closed status, as follows:

| Value          | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Open           | A new case with a status of Open, pending review.                                                                                                              | 
| Suspend Open   | A case which has been suspended that will move to an Open status again once the Diary Date has lapsed.                                                         |
| Suspend Closed | A case which has been suspended that will moved to a Closed status once the Diary Date has lapsed.                                                             |
| Closed         | A closed case whereby the Case Key and Case Key Value will be eligible for reopening.                                                                          |
| Suspend Bypass | A status indicating that a case would have been created,  except it was sampled out.  The case will move to a closed status up on the lapse of the Diary Date. |

Cases Workflows Filters are a means to access Cases via the Cases page. Case Workflow Filters allows for the filtering of cases based on a customisable filter.  To create a Cases Workflow Filter,  start by navigating to Models >>  Cases Workflows >> Cases Workflow Filter:
