# Environment Variables

In Jube, application settings can only be passed via operating system (or container) Environment Variables. The
following hardcoded Environment Variables, this would be to say defaults, are available:

| Variable                                       | Default Value                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Managing the thread pool manually can reduce apparent warm up time for the application and reduce risk of thread starvation through threads being closely sized to underlying compute resources.  All requests to the Kestrel web server will place demand on the Thread Pool, with each IO demand being made ashncronously (and likely in a seperate thread allocated by the Thread Pool).  Model invocation can be decoupled from the thread pool partially via the use of asynchronous model invocation, otherwise it forms part of the request handled by the Kestrel thread.                                                          |

Given streaming notifications the message is dispatched to the notification service in the database synchronously. A typical connection string is of the form: HOST_NAME:PORT_NUMBER,password=PASSWORD where HOST_NAME is the host name of your server (e.g. localhost), PORT_NUMBER is the port number Redis is listening on (e.g. 6379) and PASSWORD is your redis server's password (e.g. secret_password). |
