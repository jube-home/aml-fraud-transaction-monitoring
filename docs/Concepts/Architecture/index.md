# Architecture

Jube is open source transaction and event monitoring software. Jube is software for real-time data wrangling, artificial
intelligence, decision-making and case management.

Jube has wider utility; Abstraction values are returned in the real-time response payload, hence Jube can facilitate
data wrangling in a Function as a Service (FaaS) pattern. Response payload data is also stored in an addressable
fashion, to the effect of improving user experience for advanced analytical reporting, while also reducing database
resource \ compute cost.

Jube can be used in a variety of monitoring use cases, but is particularly suited for:

* Fraud or Abuse Detection and Prevention.
* IoT Service Efficiency Assurance.

Jube has only open source dependencies; It runs on commodity Linux Operating Systems and with Postgres databases. The
stateless nature of Jube allows for scaling to massive extremes.

## Software Architecture

Jube has a highly scalable architecture. Jube performs as much processing as possible in memory in predictably sized
thread capacity. Where database interactions are required, it is at a minimum against entities which are optimised to
return datasets quickly based on indexed key value pairs using a Redis instance (anything RESP
wire compatible in practice, and increasingly Jube would suggest alternatives given improved performance and fallback
persistence, such as in KeyDB). Configuration and rule compilation (this is .Net reflection) is done perpetually in
background threads so that real-time request processing is not interrupted with computationally expensive language
interpretation. Archive storage of the response payload happens asynchronously using internal concurrent queues,
sometime after the response payload has been dispatched (and usually in bulk). The Archive payload is comprehensive;
When exploited via Postgres binary JSON functions and the functionality inside Jube to promote keys, analytical
reporting capability is enhanced to a great extent.

The software is written in C# and is presented as a single binary application, although it can be taken to be stateless
for
the purposes of clustering. While a single binary, Environment Variables are used to enable or disable threads,
allocating threads based on desired architecture and work allocation.

Jube is intended to run on a commodity Linux open source infrastructure and has the following software dependencies:

* .Net 9 Runtime.
* Postgres database version 13 onwards (tested on 15.4 but no significant database development to cause a breaking
  change).
* Redis version 6 or above (it probably works fine on earlier versions, as the command used are basic. RESP
  wire compatible implies that it is possible to use KeyDB, DragonflyDB, Garnet or any RESP compliant wire protocol
  database).

Jube will of course run on Windows, or indeed any platform that is supported by the .Net runtime, however, alternative
platforms are not recommended for production use. Windows is not tested. Furthermore, Redis, KeyDB and DragonflyDB,
does not support Windows, so Cache options are limited to Postgres Database of Garnet (although there may well be other
RESP wire compatible databases that have been overlooked that work on Windows). Unclear why Windows would be a first
choice, however.

## Migration

Jube handles its own database model installation and upgrade, a process known more commonly as Migration. When Jube
starts, and after establishing a connection to the Postgres database, a check is performed against a database table
called "VersionInfo" to establish what database changes need to be made to harmonise:

```sql
select *
from "VersionInfo"
```

![VersionInfo.png](VersionInfo.png)

The list of required database changes, determined by cross-referencing the table VersionInfo with the available
Migrations compiled to the Jube instance, are subsequently executed in the specified order.

Migration requires the following DDL permissions:

* CREATE TABLE.
* CREATE INDEX.
* INSERT.

DDL permissions cannot always assure in production configurations, especially as the implementation becomes more
distributed.

Migration can be overridden by Environment Variable:

```text
EnableMigration=False
```

The default EnableMigration is set to True, and is taken to be the case throughout this documentation.

In the event Migration is disabled,
the [Fluent Migrator Command Line Runner](https://fluentmigrator.github.io/articles/runners/runner-console.html) will
need to be executed separately, targeting the Jube.Migrations.dll binary for Postgres 11.0.

Migrations do not exist as a concept for Redis as this is a schemaless Key \ Value Pair in memory database where Keys
are upserted (inserted or updated on existence). Henceforth, Redis does not have a schema, although values do have a
very specific structure native to Jube.

## Embedded Kestrel HTTP Web Server

The Jube instance exposes an embedded web server by the name Kestrel. As long as the application started
without error - itself a simple matter of ensuring the .Net runtime and Postgres database connection - then HTTP
requests can be made.

All HTTP requests will be targeted at the Kestrel webserver, and include:

* Static content such as javascript files and images not subject to authentication.
* Page HTML content which is subject to authentication, except the authentication page itself. HTML
  content and static content is entirely dependent on API controllers.
* The API controllers which are subject to authentication, except for the authentication controller itself and a public
  facing invocation endpoint. The API is a variety of endpoints that are parametrized as either JSON post bodies, and
  less frequently querystring values. The API is documented via Swagger
  at [https://localhost:5001/swagger](https://localhost:5001/swagger), once the Jube instance is running and responding
  to HTTP requests. It follows that any interaction that can be achieved in the user interface, can also be achieved via
  API directly, subject to authentication.

Authentication relies on a standard implementation of JSON web tokens stored in an HTTP header called authenticate, or an
http cookie called authentication, which must always be present except for unauthenticated resources.

The JSON web token encrypts using Environment Variables:

```text
JWTValidAudience=http://localhost:5001
JWTValidIssuer=http://localhost:5001
JWTKey=ExtraSuperDuperSecretKeyCreatedOnFirstStartup
```

| Value            | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JWTValidAudience | The server domain that is allowed the token.                                                                                                              |
| JWTValidIssuer   | The server domain that issued the token.                                                                                                                  |
| JWTKey           | The encryption key for the token.  This key is created randomly on first instantiation of Jube,  but can be changed by updating the Environment Variable. |

Notwithstanding a stateless architecture, the token contains a single claim type of
Name (http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name), which will contain only the username (e.g.
Administrator).

To the extent that it is thought by the technical end user that Containerisation differs from lightweight Linux Virtual
Machines, it is fully supported.

Environment Variables required by a Jube instance are passed aa an operating system Environment Variable (the default
way to pass invocation values to a container image).

# Cache

Redis is the cache in the Jube software architecture and assures consistent and real-time responses. Ensure the
RedisConnectionString environment variable string (simply the IP of the remote Redis Cluster) as follows:

```text
RedisConnectionString=?
```

Cache has extreme performance demands and should be entirely uncontested when real-time tolerances are demanded.
Furthermore, cache should be forced almost entirely into memory, which in the case of Redis is the only option anyway.
Ensuring that cache has an uncontested in-memory habitat is not all that achievable without offloading these entities to
a separately sized and memory optimal process and server (this is complicated by Redis being a single thread, which
makes
alternatives such as DragonflyDB, KeyDB and Garnet increasingly attractive, offering better performance and greater
consolidation).

Given Redis being used as a cache the installation by its nature will be entirely in memory and writing to
disk, which is asynchronous in the form of an Append Only Log (AOL), exists for recovery only. In memory databases like
Redis need meticulous capacity planning and monitoring, so not to allow for a situation where memory runs and keys
are evicted (a disastrous situation for Cache integrity). Key eviction is so problematic, it is suggested to consider
KeyDB and its flash capability allowing for fall back to flash, not to mention the benefits of multithreaded
performance which Redis has fallen far behind on.

A Jube instance is designed in an entirely stateless manner such to sit behind a standard HTTP load balancer. In HTTP
load balancing, requests to the load balancer are sent to different backend servers in rotation, allowing for horizontal
scalability. There is no session state within the Jube instance for any HTTP interaction, hence server affinity is not
required (state is offloaded to the Postgres databases where required).

There is no specific configuration required of a Jube instance to achieve load balancing, with the configuration being
offloaded to the load balancer itself.

A Jube instance exposes a self-hosted and embedded HTTP web server called Kestrel which supports SSL \ HTTPS schemes,
however by default the certificate is self-signed and intended to secure internal transport only. In the event a Jube
instance is made available over a public or corporate network, it is advisable to implement a reverse proxy or load
balancer for the purposes of offloading the SSL \ HTTPS schemes, even if there exists only a single backend server.
While the Kestrel embedded HTTP web server can support SSL with own certificates, it is not commonly used to support own
SSL \ HTTP schemes in production use.

## RabbitMQ Load Balanced Distributed Installation with Cache Offload

In addition to HTTP interfaces to a Jube instance, RabbitMQ (supporting AMQP protocols) can be used for model
invocation. The purpose of the RabbitMQ is to provide the following additional capabilities:

* The response payload available otherwise by HTTP response is emitted on an exchange called 'jubeOutbound' that can be
  subscribed to by consumers as required. This may takes place even if model invocation has taken place via HTTP.
* The request payload otherwise sent by HTTP request can be placed into a queue called 'jubeInbound' along with certain
  routing headers that would otherwise be in the HTTP URL stub.
* Activation Rule matches are sent to an exchange called 'jubeActivations' for consumption by the Watcher in the user
  interface, but can be otherwise subscribed to by consumers as required (noting this data is largely a reduced version
  of what is available in jubeOutbound exchange). If RabbitMQ is not enabled, the same effect is achieved for supporting
  Watcher functionality by Postgres notification or polling the Activations table in the database.
* Notifications dispatched as a consequence of an Activation Rule match can be placed to a queue called "
  jubeNotifications". If RabbitMQ is not enabled, the same effect is achieved for supporting Activation Rule Match
  Notification functionality by polling the Notifications table in the database.(notifications sent via the case
  management system are synchronous).

To enable RabbitMQ, the following Environment Variable needs to be updated:

```text
AMQP=True
AMQPUri=amqps://hostname:secret@cow.moo.cloudamqp.com/hostname
```

| Value   | Description                                                                                                                          |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AMQP    | True or False to signify that connections should be established via the AMQPUri connection string to the RabbitMQ server or cluster. |
| AMQPUri | The connection string to the RabbitMQ server.                                                                                        |

## HTTPS Highly Available Load Balanced Distributed 

Jube in a single process, but given the stateless nature it can be clustered and arranged in a highly available
manner. Given the comprehensive nature of the Jube instance, it is foreseeable that certain services, which would be
background threads consuming resources, may not be used despite being instantiated by the default Environment Variable
configuration (although they will be wait sleeping if not in use, so the effect is minimal).

The following diagram shows how the Jube instance can be arranged in a highly available fashion as backend servers to a
load balancer, yet also the extent to which services can be allocated to individual servers.

The above example would be overly distributed for most use cases, but serves to explain concepts.

The instances are provisioned for their purpose using Environment Variables. In the above diagram there is provisioning
for the following:

* Invocation API and Engine.
* Other CRUD type API functions for User Interface HTML, js and Static Content.
* Other low footprint threads.
* Exhaustive training.
* Reprocessing.
* User Interface HTML, js and Static Content.

Although presented in more detail in subsequent sections of this documentation the real-time model data is processed via
either an HTTP endpoint or an AMQP queue called jubeInbound.

In the case of the invocation HTTP API endpoint, there is no formal JSON Web Token authentication, and is instead
intended for integration, being restricted by IP filtering or network security more generally. The default is that
public user of the Invocation HTTP API endpoint is allowed, hence an Environment Variable change is not required by
default. Public invocation of the Invocation HTTP API endpoint can be restricted by updating an Environment Variable as:

```text
EnablePublicInvocationController=False
```

Model processing relies on a complex set of background threads collectively referred to as the engine.

While the embedded Kestrel HTTP web service is responsible for processing requests, it is transposed to the engine.

AMQP meanwhile is handled directly via the engine.

Generally speaking, all but the most rudimentary user interface serving requires the engine to be enabled in the
Environment Variable. The engine is enabled by default but can be disabled by Environment Variable:

```text
EnableEngine=False
```

Several threads are instantiated by the engine as default, but can be disabled from their default via Environment
Variables:

```text
EnableSanctions=False
EnableReprocessing=False
ReprocessingThreads=1
EnableExhaustiveTraining=False
EnableCacheIndex=False
EnableCasesAutomation=False
EnableSearchKeyCache=False
EnableTTLCounter=False
EnableNotification=False
```

|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EnableSanctions          | Responsible for loading and serving sanctions check requests on the instance (in both model processing and direct request via HTTP).                                                                                                                                                                           |
| EnableReprocessing       | Responsible for reprocessing data from the archive though the models in a similar manner as real-time.  Useful when new model configuration has been put in place and data needs to be modified.  It is extremely intensive. Has provision for concurrency between instances and multiple ReprocessingThreads. |
| ReprocessingThreads      | The number of threads allocated to reprocessing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| EnableExhaustiveTraining | Responsible for training anomaly detection and neural network models.  A computationally expensive process and care should be taken to isolate from real-time processes for risk of degradation of real-time model invocation response time.                                                                   |
| EnableCasesAutomation    | Responsible for case scheduling,  specifically the reopening and closing of cases on lapse of expiry date.  This routine has poor concurrency and it is suggested that there be only a single instance at this time.                                                                                           |
| EnableSearchKeyCache     | Responsible for the background processing of Abstraction Rules designated as being cached (this is aggregations having been precomputed rather than being online in the real-time model invocation).  There may only be a single instance as there is no concurrency available.                                |
| EnableTTLCounter         | Responsible for the background maintenance of TTLCounters. There may only be a single instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| EnableNotification       | Responsible for the background dispatch of Notifications, either by connecting to RabbitMQ or maintaining a polling thread against a Notifications in memory concurrent queue.                                                                                                                                 |
| CachePruneServer         | Responsible for the deletion of data from CachePayload and CachePayloadLatest entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| WaitCachePrune           | The time in milliseconds between the cache being pruned for expired payload and latest entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Such is the reliance of Jube upon the Kestrel HTTP web server, there is no means to disable it, henceforth - and subject
to JSON web token header authentication in many cases - User Interface HTML, js and Static Content and other CRUD type
API functions. will always be available.

## Database and Cache High Availability Considerations

A Jube instance is stateless however the platform application itself would be stateful given a dependence on the
database and cache.

High availability of the Postgres database nor Redis is outside the scope of this documentation, as the manner in which
high
availability is achieved is standard and generic.

It is suggested that storage be offloaded to highly durable external storage in the case of archive and highly
performance local storage in the case of Cache. WAL should be written to separate high performance disks and
asynchronous write usage maximised. In the context of resilient failover with disks offloaded, the failure of the
Postgres instance is quite implausible, the implementation can be scaled up, rather than out which is both easier and
cheaper.
